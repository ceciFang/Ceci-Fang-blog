## There's more life than happy

I used to think whole purpose of life was pursuing happiness. Everyone said the path to happiness was success,so I searched for that ideal job, that perfec boyfriend, that beautiful apartment. But instead of ever feeling fulfilled, I feld anxious and adrift. And I wasn't alone; my friends -- they struggled whith this too.

Eventually, I decided to go to graduate school for positive paychology to learn what truly makes people happy.But waht I discovered there changed my life. The data showed that chasing happiness can make people unhappy.And what really struck me was this: the suicide rate has been rising around th word,and it recently reached a 30-year hight in America.
